In this video we have tried to clone the functionality of System.out.println() with a hope that after learning this, viewers will get a clear understanding of the API works internally.

Source code for this video can be found in the below GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/ChanSek/ChanseCode).

If you have any further questions, we can discuss in the comment section.

If you have any API in mind which you want us to cover in our future videos, then please do let us know about that API. We will try our best to cover the API soon.
